# SchottkyLink  
## An interactive visualization system on a family of Kleinian groups based on Schottky groups  
We developed an algorithm for drawing images of a family of Kleinian groups based on Schottky groups. This algorithm is called an Iterated Inversion System (IIS). IIS allows us to perform calculation in parallel and render images fast.  
In this system, any generator is given by the inversion of a circle (or a sphere or a plane) or a composition of some inversions. Here it is important for us to observe and control these generators in a geometrical way. We can easily explore complicated groups including 4 dimensional Kleinian groups. This system will be helpful to researchers and also fractal artists.
